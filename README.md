## AI Model Creation from Prompt
This repository demonstrates the process of creating an AI model from a prompt using Stable Diffusion.

## Usage Clone the Repository

bash Copy code git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-model-creation.git cd ai-model-creation Set Up a Virtual Environment

bash Copy code python3 -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate Install Dependencies

bash Copy code pip install -r requirements.txt Generate AI Model from Prompt

python Copy code from stable_diffusion import StableDiffusion

## Initialize the Stable Diffusion model
model = StableDiffusion()

## Define your text prompt
text_prompt = "A powerful AI model capable of understanding complex tasks."

## Generate the AI model
ai_model = model.create_model(text_prompt)

## Save the AI model
ai_model.save("output/ai_model.pth") Use the Generated AI Model

Once the AI model is generated, you can use it for various tasks such as natural language processing, image recognition, or any other task depending on the prompt provided.
